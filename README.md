# This is Just Blow 'Em Up!



## What is this abominatiion
 - A game I made in ``` pygame ```

      - You are a retired demolition expert, with nothing to do ... EXCEPT BLOW THINGS UP!
      - You can do jobs for people using variable amount of bombs.

 - being able to close the game(surprisingly forgot to make this)
